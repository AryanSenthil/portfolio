    "### The Cavendish Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cavendish experiment, first performed by Henry Cavendish in 1798, is a landmark physics experiment designed to measure the gravitational constant (G) and, consequently, the mass of the Earth. The experiment uses a torsion balance consisting of two small masses suspended from a fiber, with two larger masses positioned nearby. \n",
    "\n",
    "As gravitational attraction between the masses causes the balance to twist, a laser beam reflected from a mirror attached to the balance projects onto a screen, amplifying the small angular deflections into measurable linear displacements.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Measurement Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate determination of the gravitational constant requires precise tracking of the laser spot position over extended time periods (often several hours). The periodic oscillation of the torsion balance produces a characteristic sinusoidal pattern in the position data, from which the gravitational force and ultimately G can be calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the traditional measurement methodology presented significant challenges that threatened data quality and experimental efficiency.\n",

    "## <span style=\"color: #dc3545;\">The Problem</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Cavendish experiment, precise measurement of laser projection coordinates on a screen is critical for determining the gravitational constant. The traditional methodology required a two-person team operating continuously:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One person** observing and verbally reporting coordinates from the screen\n",
    "- **Another person** manually recording these values every 15 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Was Problematic\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human error:** Fatigue and attention lapses during extended observation periods\n",
    "- **Low sampling rate:** 15-second intervals limited temporal resolution\n",
    "- **Labor intensive:** Required two researchers for the duration of each experimental run\n",
    "- **Transcription errors:** Verbal communication and manual note-taking increased data corruption risk\n",

    "I developed an automated algorithm in **Wolfram Mathematica** that eliminated manual observation entirely. The algorithm captures and processes laser projection video to extract coordinate measurements with superior accuracy. \n",
